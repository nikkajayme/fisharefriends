                The Siamese fighting fish <i>(Betta splendens)</i>, commonly known as "The Betta", are colorful, fancy-finned fishes, which can grow to a length of about 6.5 - 7 cm (2.5 - 2.7 in). Native to Southeast Asia, but popularly bred in Thailand. Over time, their popularity has spread not only across Asia but all over the world.

                <p class="pg_tank">
                    Bowls are too small for the betta fish. Keeping them in a 5-gallon glass or plastic tank allows the betta fish to exhibit normal activity and will result in less build-up of toxins in the tank.

                <br>
            <h4 class="bettacare_water">Tank Water</h4><br>
                <p class="pg_water">
                    For tap water, apply water conditioner as tap water could contain chlorine/chloramine or heavy metals. Water should be dechlorinated. You can also use mineral water. Installing a low flow filter is also advisable. Make sure your tank water is not too cold! Bettas live in tropical countries which means they like it warm. Temperature of 24-28 °C (75-82 °F) for tank water is the best way to go.

                <br>
            <h4 class="bettacare_food">Betta Food</h4><br>
                <p class="pg_food">
                    They feed on brine shrimp, larvae and worms (daphnia, mosquito larvae, blood worms, etc.) You can also feed them balanced pellet or flake. Do not overfeed. Per day, they should be fed an amount of food they can eat within 3-5mins without leftover. Leftovers can cause the tank water to become contaminated.

                    If your betta lives in a large tank, he may get bored. Try adding other species to keep your betta happy and make your tank look livelier.

                    Females have shorter fins, more dull color than their male counterparts. If you look at the belly of a female betta you will notice a white spot called the egg spot.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Not to be confused with Plakat betta as female bettas have tails that are thinner and have less taper.

            <h3 id="bb">Breeding Bettas</h3><br>
            <h4>Selecting the pair</h4><br>
                <p>Male should be well conditioned, supply them vitamins and feed them live food. Another good sign from the male is being aggressive.</p><br>
                <p>For the female, same with the male. They should be conditioned. And to determine whether your female is ready for breeding, the belly should be larger which means the eggs are healthier and bigger - higher survival rate for the offspring.</p><br>
            <h4>Breeding Tank</h4><br>
                <img src="images\breedingtank4.jpg" alt="breeding tank">
                <br>
                <p>You can use a glass tank or plastic containers at least 12 inches wide. But make sure that the material of the container you will use is not toxic. For the water, you can use water from other fish tanks or you can also use stock water just make sure it is free from chlorine and not contaminated. Add plants to culture infusoria and almond leaves to increase fertility. Fill the container with water at least 3 to 4 inches deep. Place the tank in a well-lit area to stimulate the growth of bacteria.</p><br>
            <h4>Transferring the Pair</h4><br>                
                <p>Place a transparent container to separate the female from the male. Leave them together for 12 hours. It’s better to place them in the tank at 12 noon and merge them at 6am the next day. You will know when the male is ready if it already built a bubble nest.</p><br>
                <img src="images\bubblenest1.jpg" alt="bubblenest">
                <br>
            <h4>Mating</h4><br>
                <p>It is normal for the male to be aggressive to the female but make sure that you place a large leaf or a live plant for the female to hide at. Place a glass or transparent cover on your breeding tank to avoid the betta fish from jumping out. It also advisable to place some leaves on top to give the pair some privacy and for less disturbance when passing near the tank. You will know that they have successfully mated if there are white spots on the nest. These are the betta eggs.</p>

                <p>On the 3rd day the eggs will hatch. Keep them with the male until the fry are in free swim stage then remove the male from the fry. It’s good to have live plants in the tank as baby bettas eat the infusoria from these plants. Remove about an inch of water from your breeding tank so that the baby bettas can find there food quickly and grow faster.</p><br>
            <h5>Betta fry food:</h5><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baby brine shrimp</li>
                    <li>Infusoria</li>
                    <li>Egg yolk</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <p>After a week they can be fed baby brine shrimp, but larger betta types can be fed baby brine shrimp at the start of free swim stage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fin Rot - antibiotic medications like sulfadimidine and erythromycin are usually effective</li>
                <li>Ich - Salt bath or medications like malachite green. Raise temperature of water</li>
                <li>Popeye - antibiotics like tetracycline</li>
                <li>Velvet - Salt bath or medications</li>
                <li>Dropsy - Salt bath and antibacterial fish food (food mixed with chloromycetin and tetracycline)</li>

            </ul><br>
            <p>The earlier you treat your betta the higher the possibility your betta will fully recover, so keep an eye out for these symptoms:</p><br>

                    <li>Parts of body swelling</li>
